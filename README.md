This repository contains code used to identify vehicles in images and video feeds. The project mainly uses computer vision techniques and machine learning to identify vehicles.

A sample output of the final pipeline for this project is shown below. Also, take a look at the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jeffwen/sdcnd_vehicle_detection/blob/master/Vehicle%20Detection.ipynb) and the [write-up](https://github.com/jeffwen/sdcnd_vehicle_detection/blob/master/vehicle_detection.md) for more details.
